# CUBE
Project CUBE is a prime example of embdd's end-to-end product development capabilities. It serves as a demonstration of our ability to take an idea and turn it into a tangible product. It is a showcase of our skills in research, design, engineering, manufacturing, and customer support, all working together to bring a successful product to market.

This project is an open-source product and all design files, including firmware and mechanical schematics, are readily available for download
